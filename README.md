# Lung Mircobiome Data Analysis

## Microbiome data from lung are used to do analysis on possible mortality prediction on 30, 60 and 90 intubation period.

Only 0.2%  changes were seen when we removed zero variance features from the dataset.
The sparse features removed from the dataset were not critical in explaining the primary patterns data.
